        "There are two different ways you can use decorators on classes. The first one is very close to what you have already done with functions: you can decorate the methods of a class. This was one of the motivations for introducing decorators back in the day.\n",

        "#### Commonly used decorators: `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, and `@property`\n",
        "Some commonly used decorators that are even built-ins in Python are `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, and `@property`. The @classmethod and @staticmethod decorators are used to define methods inside a class namespace that are not connected to a particular instance of that class. The @property decorator is used to customize getters and setters for class attributes. Expand the box below for an example using these decorators."
